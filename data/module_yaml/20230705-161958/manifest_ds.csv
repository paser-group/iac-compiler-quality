        Use variables to create new hosts and groups in inventory for
        use in later plays of the same playbook. Takes variables so
        you can define the new hosts more fully. This module is also
        supported for Windows targets.

NOTES:
      * The alias `host' of the parameter `name' is only
        available on Ansible 2.4 and newer.
      * Since Ansible 2.4, the `inventory_dir' variable is now
        set to `None' instead of the 'global inventory source',
        because you can now have multiple sources.  An example
        was added that shows how to partially restore the
        previous behaviour.
      * Though this module does not change the remote host, we
        do provide 'changed' status as it can be useful for
        those trying to track inventory changes.
      * The hosts added will not bypass the `--limit' from the
        command line, so both of those need to be in agreement
        to make them available as play targets. They are still
        available from hostvars and for delegation as a normal
        part of the inventory.

Description:
As an Ansible Compiler Debugger & Heuristic Test Engineer, your primary responsibility is to detect and resolve latent type-related bugs in the Ansible compiler. Your role entails crafting intricate, heuristic-based Ansible playbooks, which are tailored to both specific network architectures and a designated Ansible module.
Your main tasks include:
1. Focusing on a designated Ansible module and gaining a thorough understanding of its features and functions. From this understanding, you will develop appropriate heuristic-driven test scenarios, paying close attention to each attribute and option the module offers.
2. Creating Ansible playbooks that are adapted to precise network architectures. Specifically, you'll work with a setup that includes an inventory file with three Docker nodes running Ubuntu images, connected to a network named 'node-net' with a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 and a gateway of 10.1.1.254. The nodes and their respective IP addresses are: node1 - 10.1.1.1, node2 - 10.1.1.2, and node3 - 10.1.1.3. Your playbook designs should reflect these network specifics and requirements.
3. Identifying and addressing potential type-related bugs in the Ansible compiler. This includes designing and implementing heuristic-driven test scenarios, such as assessing mixed case sensitivity, using different data types in configuration values, and generating random network identifiers.
This role requires robust expertise in Ansible, superior debugging skills, a deep understanding of various network architectures, and proficiency in heuristic-based testing methodologies. The primary goal is to enhance the resilience of the Ansible compiler, ensuring it can handle a diverse range of module configurations without errors. ","Your primary task as an Ansible Compiler Debugger & Heuristic Test Engineer is to author a comprehensive Ansible playbook. The focal point is on constructing heuristic-based test scenarios for a specific Ansible module - ansible.builtin.add_host. It's crucial that the playbook is self-contained and defines all necessary variables within it.
To fulfill this, follow these steps:
1. Build an in-depth understanding of the designated Ansible module - ansible.builtin.add_host which Add a host (and alternatively a group) to the ansible-playboo..., formulating relevant test scenarios based on its unique options and attributes: groups (list), name (str), 
2. Develop the playbook with an emphasis on crafting heuristic-driven test scenarios. Utilize the following heuristics:
- Identify potential bugs in the Ansible compiler that might be triggered by mixed case sensitivity for string configuration values. - Introduce byte string values in place of regular strings. - Create configuration values that incorporate both bytes and strings. - Generate random MAC addresses for network modules. - Produce random port numbers to test port settings. - Generate strings with varied encodings. - Implement division-based operations when assigning limit-related values. - Use !null as configuration values in manifests. - Formulate random IP addresses for recently introduced networking modules.
Through the use of these heuristics, your playbook will be capable of robustly managing a diverse range of scenarios, strengthening the Ansible compiler's resilience in handling various configurations of the ansible.builtin.add_host. ","Certainly! Here's a syntactically correct Ansible code snippet that focuses on the issue mentioned and has the potential to expose new bugs in the Ansible compiler:

```yaml
---
- name: Heuristic-driven test playbook for ansible.builtin.add_host
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: Test scenario - Mixed case sensitivity
      ansible.builtin.add_host:
        groups:
          - mygroup
        name: ""{{ item | upper }}""
      loop:
        - myhost1
        - myhost2
        - myhost3
```

In this code snippet, the test scenario focuses on mixed case sensitivity. The playbook attempts to add hosts to a specific group by using the ansible.builtin.add_host module. The `name` attribute is set to `{{ item | upper }}` to convert the hosts to uppercase using the `upper` filter. The `loop` directive is used to iterate through a list of host names.

When executing this playbook, it has the potential to uncover any bugs related to mixed case sensitivity in the Ansible compiler. The goal is to verify whether the compiler correctly handles different case variations when adding hosts to a group.",1,"---

        Manages `apt' packages (such as for Debian/Ubuntu).

ADDED IN: version 0.0.2 of ansible-core

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- allow_change_held_packages
        Allows changing the version of a package which is on the apt
        hold list
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.13 of ansible-core


- allow_downgrade
        Corresponds to the `--allow-downgrades' option for `apt'.
        This option enables the named package and version to replace
        an already installed higher version of that package.
        Note that setting `allow_downgrade=true' can make this module
        behave in a non-idempotent way.
        (The task could end up with a set of packages that does not
        match the complete list of specified packages to install).
        aliases: [allow-downgrade, allow_downgrades, allow-downgrades]
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.12 of ansible-core


- allow_unauthenticated
        Ignore if packages cannot be authenticated. This is useful for
        bootstrapping environments that manage their own apt-key
        setup.
        `allow_unauthenticated' is only supported with state:
        `install'/`present'
        aliases: [allow-unauthenticated]
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.1 of ansible-core


- autoclean
        If `true', cleans the local repository of retrieved package
        files that can no longer be downloaded.
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.4 of ansible-core


- autoremove
        If `true', remove unused dependency packages for all module
        states except `build-dep'. It can also be used as the only
        option.
        Previous to version 2.4, autoclean was also an alias for
        autoremove, now it is its own separate command. See
        documentation for further information.
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.1 of ansible-core


- cache_valid_time
        Update the apt cache if it is older than the
        `cache_valid_time'. This option is set in seconds.
        As of Ansible 2.4, if explicitly set, this sets
        `update_cache=yes'.
        default: 0
        type: int

- clean
        Run the equivalent of `apt-get clean' to clear out the local
        repository of retrieved package files. It removes everything
        but the lock file from /var/cache/apt/archives/ and
        /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/.
        Can be run as part of the package installation (clean runs
        before install) or as a separate step.
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.13 of ansible-core


- deb
        Path to a .deb package on the remote machine.
        If :// in the path, ansible will attempt to download deb
        before installing. (Version added 2.1)
        Requires the `xz-utils' package to extract the control file of
        the deb package to install.
        default: null
        type: path
        added in: version 1.6 of ansible-core


- default_release
        Corresponds to the `-t' option for `apt' and sets pin
        priorities
        aliases: [default-release]
        default: null
        type: str

- dpkg_options
        Add dpkg options to apt command. Defaults to '-o
        ""Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef"" -o ""Dpkg::Options::=--force-
        confold""'
        Options should be supplied as comma separated list
        default: force-confdef,force-confold
        type: str

- fail_on_autoremove
        Corresponds to the `--no-remove' option for `apt'.
        If `true', it is ensured that no packages will be removed or
        the task will fail.
        `fail_on_autoremove' is only supported with state except
        `absent'
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.11 of ansible-core


- force
        Corresponds to the `--force-yes' to `apt-get' and implies
        `allow_unauthenticated: yes' and `allow_downgrade: yes'
        This option will disable checking both the packages'
        signatures and the certificates of the web servers they are
        downloaded from.
        This option *is not* the equivalent of passing the `-f' flag
        to `apt-get' on the command line
        **This is a destructive operation with the potential to
        destroy your system, and it should almost never be used.**
        Please also see `man apt-get' for more information.
        default: 'no'
        type: bool

- force_apt_get
        Force usage of apt-get instead of aptitude
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.4 of ansible-core


- install_recommends
        Corresponds to the `--no-install-recommends' option for `apt'.
        `true' installs recommended packages.  `false' does not
        install recommended packages. By default, Ansible will use the
        same defaults as the operating system. Suggested packages are
        never installed.
        aliases: [install-recommends]
        default: null
        type: bool

- lock_timeout
        How many seconds will this action wait to acquire a lock on
        the apt db.
        Sometimes there is a transitory lock and this will retry at
        least until timeout is hit.
        default: 60
        type: int
        added in: version 2.12 of ansible-core


- name
        A list of package names, like `foo', or package specifier with
        version, like `foo=1.0' or `foo>=1.0'. Name wildcards
        (fnmatch) like `apt*' and version wildcards like `foo=1.0*'
        are also supported.
        aliases: [package, pkg]
        default: null
        elements: str
        type: list

- only_upgrade
        Only upgrade a package if it is already installed.
        default: 'no'
        type: bool
        added in: version 2.1 of ansible-core


- policy_rc_d
        Force the exit code of /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d.
        For example, if `policy_rc_d=101' the installed package will
        not trigger a service start.
        If /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d already exists, it is backed up and
        restored after the package installation.
        If `null', the /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d isn't created/changed.
        default: null
        type: int
        added in: version 2.8 of ansible-core


- purge
        Will force purging of configuration files if the module state
        is set to `absent'.
        default: 'no'
        type: bool

- state
        Indicates the desired package state. `latest' ensures that the
        latest version is installed. `build-dep' ensures the package
        build dependencies are installed. `fixed' attempt to correct a
        system with broken dependencies in place.
        choices: [absent, build-dep, latest, present, fixed]
        default: present
        type: str

- update_cache
        Run the equivalent of `apt-get update' before the operation.
        Can be run as part of the package installation or as a
        separate step.
        Default is not to update the cache.
        aliases: [update-cache]
        default: null
        type: bool

- update_cache_retries
        Amount of retries if the cache update fails. Also see
        `update_cache_retry_max_delay'.
        default: 5
        type: int
        added in: version 2.10 of ansible-core


- update_cache_retry_max_delay
        Use an exponential backoff delay for each retry (see
        `update_cache_retries') up to this max delay in seconds.
        default: 12
        type: int
        added in: version 2.10 of ansible-core


- upgrade
        If yes or safe, performs an aptitude safe-upgrade.
        If full, performs an aptitude full-upgrade.
        If dist, performs an apt-get dist-upgrade.
        Note: This does not upgrade a specific package, use
        state=latest for that.
        Note: Since 2.4, apt-get is used as a fall-back if aptitude is
        not present.
        choices: [dist, full, 'no', safe, 'yes']
        default: 'no'
        type: str
        added in: version 1.1 of ansible-core



ATTRIBUTES:

        check_mode:
          description: Can run in check_mode and return changed status prediction without
            modifying target
          support: full

          description: Target OS/families that can be operated against
          platforms: debian
          support: N/A

NOTES:
      * Three of the upgrade modes (`full', `safe' and its alias
        `true') required `aptitude' up to 2.3, since 2.4 `apt-
        get' is used as a fall-back.
      * In most cases, packages installed with apt will start
        newly installed services by default. Most distributions
        have mechanisms to avoid this. For example when
        installing Postgresql-9.5 in Debian 9, creating an
        excutable shell script (/usr/sbin/policy-rc.d) that
        throws a return code of 101 will stop Postgresql 9.5
        starting up after install. Remove the file or remove its
        execute permission afterwards.
      * The apt-get commandline supports implicit regex matches
        here but we do not because it can let typos through
        easier (If you typo `foo' as `fo' apt-get would install
        packages that have ""fo"" in their name with a warning and
        a prompt for the user. Since we don't have warnings and
        prompts before installing we disallow this.Use an
        explicit fnmatch pattern if you want wildcarding)
      * When used with a `loop:' each package will be processed
        individually, it is much more efficient to pass the list
        directly to the `name' option.
      * When `default_release' is used, an implicit priority of
        990 is used. This is the same behavior as `apt-get -t'.
      * When an exact version is specified, an implicit priority
        of 1001 is used.

Description:
As an Ansible Compiler Debugger & Heuristic Test Engineer, your primary responsibility is to detect and resolve latent type-related bugs in the Ansible compiler. Your role entails crafting intricate, heuristic-based Ansible playbooks, which are tailored to both specific network architectures and a designated Ansible module.
Your main tasks include:
1. Focusing on a designated Ansible module and gaining a thorough understanding of its features and functions. From this understanding, you will develop appropriate heuristic-driven test scenarios, paying close attention to each attribute and option the module offers.
2. Creating Ansible playbooks that are adapted to precise network architectures. Specifically, you'll work with a setup that includes an inventory file with three Docker nodes running Ubuntu images, connected to a network named 'node-net' with a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 and a gateway of 10.1.1.254. The nodes and their respective IP addresses are: node1 - 10.1.1.1, node2 - 10.1.1.2, and node3 - 10.1.1.3. Your playbook designs should reflect these network specifics and requirements.
3. Identifying and addressing potential type-related bugs in the Ansible compiler. This includes designing and implementing heuristic-driven test scenarios, such as assessing mixed case sensitivity, using different data types in configuration values, and generating random network identifiers.
This role requires robust expertise in Ansible, superior debugging skills, a deep understanding of various network architectures, and proficiency in heuristic-based testing methodologies. The primary goal is to enhance the resilience of the Ansible compiler, ensuring it can handle a diverse range of module configurations without errors. ","Your primary task as an Ansible Compiler Debugger & Heuristic Test Engineer is to author a comprehensive Ansible playbook. The focal point is on constructing heuristic-based test scenarios for a specific Ansible module - ansible.builtin.apt. It's crucial that the playbook is self-contained and defines all necessary variables within it.
To fulfill this, follow these steps:
1. Build an in-depth understanding of the designated Ansible module - ansible.builtin.apt which ..., formulating relevant test scenarios based on its unique options and attributes: allow_change_held_packages (bool), allow_downgrade (bool), allow_unauthenticated (bool), autoclean (bool), autoremove (bool), cache_valid_time (int), clean (bool), deb (path), default_release (str), dpkg_options (str), fail_on_autoremove (bool), force (bool), force_apt_get (bool), install_recommends (bool), lock_timeout (int), name (list), only_upgrade (bool), policy_rc_d (int), purge (bool), state (str), update_cache (bool), update_cache_retries (int), update_cache_retry_max_delay (int), upgrade (str), 
2. Develop the playbook with an emphasis on crafting heuristic-driven test scenarios. Utilize the following heuristics:
- Identify potential bugs in the Ansible compiler that might be triggered by mixed case sensitivity for string configuration values. - Introduce byte string values in place of regular strings. - Create configuration values that incorporate both bytes and strings. - Generate random MAC addresses for network modules. - Produce random port numbers to test port settings. - Generate strings with varied encodings. - Implement division-based operations when assigning limit-related values. - Use !null as configuration values in manifests. - Formulate random IP addresses for recently introduced networking modules.
Through the use of these heuristics, your playbook will be capable of robustly managing a diverse range of scenarios, strengthening the Ansible compiler's resilience in handling various configurations of the ansible.builtin.apt. ","Certainly! Here's an example of a syntactically correct Ansible playbook that focuses on the `ansible.builtin.apt` module and can potentially expose new bugs in the Ansible compiler when executed:

        Add or remove an `apt' key, optionally downloading it.

ADDED IN: version 1.0 of ansible-core

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- data
        The keyfile contents to add to the keyring.
        default: null
        type: str

- file
        The path to a keyfile on the remote server to add to the
        keyring.
        default: null

        The identifier of the key.
        Including this allows check mode to correctly report the
        changed state.
        If specifying a subkey's id be aware that apt-key does not
        understand how to remove keys via a subkey id.  Specify the
        primary key's id instead.
        This parameter is required when `state' is set to `absent'.
        default: null
        type: str

- keyring
        The full path to specific keyring file in
        `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/'.

        default: present
        type: str

- url
        The URL to retrieve key from.
        default: null
        type: str

- validate_certs
        If `false', SSL certificates for the target url will not be
        validated. This should only be used on personally controlled
        sites using self-signed certificates.
        default: 'yes'
        type: bool


ATTRIBUTES:

        check_mode:
          description: Can run in check_mode and return changed status prediction without
            modifying target
          support: full

NOTES:
      * The apt-key command has been deprecated and suggests to
        'manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead'. See the
        Debian wiki for details. This module is kept for
        backwards compatibility for systems that still use apt-
        key as the main way to manage apt repository keys.
      * As a sanity check, downloaded key id must match the one
        specified.
      * Use full fingerprint (40 characters) key ids to avoid
        key collisions. To generate a full-fingerprint imported
        key: `apt-key adv --list-public-keys --with-fingerprint
        --with-colons'.
      * If you specify both the key id and the URL with
        `state=present', the task can verify or add the key as
        needed.
      * Adding a new key requires an apt cache update (e.g.
        using the [ansible.builtin.apt] module's update_cache
        option).
