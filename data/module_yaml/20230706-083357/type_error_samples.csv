        This module provides user management for ejabberd servers

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

= host
        the ejabberd host associated with this username
        type: str

- logging
        enables or disables the local syslog facility for this module
        default: false
        type: bool

- password
        the password to assign to the username
        default: null
        type: str

- state
        describe the desired state of the user to be managed
        choices: [present, absent]
        default: present
        type: str

= username
        the name of the user to manage
        type: str


ATTRIBUTES:

        check_mode:
          description: Can run in `check_mode' and return changed status prediction without
            modifying target.
          support: full
        diff_mode:
          description: Will return details on what has changed (or possibly needs changing
            in `check_mode'), when in diff mode.
          support: none

NOTES:
      * Password parameter is required for state == present only
      * Passwords must be stored in clear text for this release
      * The ejabberd configuration file must include
        mod_admin_extra as a module.

Description:
As an Ansible Compiler Debugger & Heuristic Test Engineer, your primary responsibility is to detect and resolve latent type-related bugs in the Ansible compiler. Your role entails crafting intricate, heuristic-based Ansible playbooks, which are tailored to both specific network architectures and a designated Ansible module.
Your main tasks include:
1. Focusing on a designated Ansible module and gaining a thorough understanding of its features and functions. From this understanding, you will develop appropriate heuristic-driven test scenarios, paying close attention to each attribute and option the module offers.
2. Creating Ansible playbooks that are adapted to precise network architectures. Specifically, you'll work with a setup that includes an inventory file with three Docker nodes running Ubuntu images, connected to a network named 'node-net' with a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 and a gateway of 10.1.1.254. The nodes and their respective IP addresses are: node1 - 10.1.1.1, node2 - 10.1.1.2, and node3 - 10.1.1.3. Your playbook designs should reflect these network specifics and requirements.
3. Identifying and addressing potential type-related bugs in the Ansible compiler. This includes designing and implementing heuristic-driven test scenarios, such as assessing mixed case sensitivity, using different data types in configuration values, and generating random network identifiers.
This role requires robust expertise in Ansible, superior debugging skills, a deep understanding of various network architectures, and proficiency in heuristic-based testing methodologies. The primary goal is to enhance the resilience of the Ansible compiler, ensuring it can handle a diverse range of module configurations without errors. ","Your primary task as an Ansible Compiler Debugger & Heuristic Test Engineer is to author a comprehensive Ansible playbook. The focal point is on constructing heuristic-based test scenarios for a specific Ansible module - community.general.ejabberd_user. It's crucial that the playbook is self-contained and defines all necessary variables within it.
To fulfill this, follow these steps:
1. Build an in-depth understanding of the designated Ansible module - community.general.ejabberd_user which Manages users..., formulating relevant test scenarios based on its unique options and attributes: host (str), logging (bool), password (str), state (str), username (str), 
2. Develop the playbook with an emphasis on crafting heuristic-driven test scenarios. Utilize the following heuristics:
- Identify potential bugs in the Ansible compiler that might be triggered by mixed case sensitivity for string configuration values. - Introduce byte string values in place of regular strings. - Create configuration values that incorporate both bytes and strings. - Generate random MAC addresses for network modules. - Produce random port numbers to test port settings. - Generate strings with varied encodings. - Implement division-based operations when assigning limit-related values. - Use !null as configuration values in manifests. - Formulate random IP addresses for recently introduced networking modules.
Through the use of these heuristics, your playbook will be capable of robustly managing a diverse range of scenarios, strengthening the Ansible compiler's resilience in handling various configurations of the community.general.ejabberd_user. ","I apologize for the mistake. Here's a revised version of the Ansible playbook that is syntactically correct and designed to expose potential bugs in the Ansible compiler:

```yaml

  vars:
    username: admin_user
