# Example playbook with extra-vars
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Print value of extra var
      debug:
        var: my_variable
      
# Run the playbook with extra-vars
ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml --extra-vars " my_variable=value"

# The above command will fail with an error: "ERROR! Attempted to read "/path/to/my/playbook.yml" as YAML: 'mapping values are not allowed in this context'"

# To fix the issue, remove the leading whitespace before the extra-vars:
ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml --extra-vars "my_variable=value"
