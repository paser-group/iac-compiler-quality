      The task attempts to perform a mathematical operation (addition) between a string '10' and an integer 5 using the `set_fact` module.
      This is expected to result in a string '105' due to type coercion in Ansible.
      If the result is different from the expected value, it indicates a potential latent type-related bug in the Ansible compiler.
