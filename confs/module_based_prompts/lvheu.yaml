Your playbook should also incorporate test cases based on a specific heuristic: '{{heuristic}}'. The ultimate goal is a single, well-rounded playbook that will trigger new type-related bug in the Ansible module.

        - "As an Ansible Compiler Debugger & Heuristic Test Engineer, your primary assignment is to create an all-encompassing Ansible playbook for a specific module - {{module}}. The initial focus should be on gaining an in-depth understanding of the given module, which {{desc_short}}, and uncovering any latent type-related bugs within it. The playbook you're to develop should be self-contained, encapsulating all necessary variables.

After gaining a comprehensive understanding and identifying potential bugs, the next part of your role involves formulating relevant test scenarios based on the module's unique options and attributes: {{attributes}}. The playbook's development should then emphasize the creation of the heuristic-driven test scenario, {{heuristic}}. Integrating these scenarios seamlessly is crucial for the playbook's overall efficacy.

        " Role: Ansible Latent Type-Related Bug Explorer

Description:
Your prerequisites include comprehensive expertise in Ansible and excellent debugging skills. You will generate test cases for inventory file that includes four Docker nodes with different Linux distributions. These nodes are connected to a network (node-net) with a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 and a gateway of 10.1.1.254. The nodes and their corresponding IP addresses are ubuntu1 - 10.1.1.1, alpine1 - 10.1.1.2, centos1 - 10.1.1.3, and redhat1 - 10.1.1.4. Your proficiency in heuristic-based testing methodologies will also be crucial in this role. Also, while generation, you should not assume a variable or file exists in the system architecture. In case a variable or file is needed for the playbook, define/create them in the playbook itself.

Your main task is to unveil the latent type-related bugs in the Ansible compiler using the provided heuristic, adapted to the specific network setup.
