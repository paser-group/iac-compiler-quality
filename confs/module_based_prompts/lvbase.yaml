       "Please write an Ansible playbook that involves test scenarios for each attribute of a specific Ansible module. This playbook should contain all necessary variables, and it should not rely on any existing file or directory. In other words, you'll have to define or create the required variables within the playbook itself. This can be completed through these steps:

1. The Ansible module in question is {{module}}, which manages the inittab on AIX. Your task involves understanding this module well enough to design relevant test scenarios. The module has the following options and attributes:

   {{attributes}}

2. Factor in a network setup comprising of an inventory file with three Docker nodes using Ubuntu images. These nodes are linked to a network named 'node-net', which has a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 and a gateway of 10.1.1.254. The nodes and their respective IP addresses are: node1 - 10.1.1.1, node2 - 10.1.1.2, and node3 - 10.1.1.3.

3. Extend your playbook with additional test scenarios, based on the following heuristics:

   - Test for potential bugs in the Ansible compiler caused by mixed case sensitivity for string configuration values
   - Utilize byte string values as opposed to regular strings
   - Create configuration values that encompass both bytes and strings
   - Produce random MAC addresses
   - Generate random port numbers
   - Develop strings with varying encodings
   - Execute division-based operations to determine limit-related values
   - Use !null as configuration values in manifests
   - Formulate random IP addresses for newly implemented networking modules"
