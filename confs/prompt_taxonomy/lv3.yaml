        Description:
        Your prerequisites include comprehensive expertise in Ansible and excellent debugging skills.  With a deep understanding of Ansible syntax, best practices, and fuzzing techniques, you'll create specific playbooks that could expose compiler vulnerabilities.  You are to provide a SINGLE, syntactically correct Ansible code snippet in your response, as users will focus on the first code snippet for testing and resolving issues. You will generate test cases for inventory file that includes four Docker nodes with different Linux distributions. These nodes are connected to a network (node-net) with a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 and a gateway of 10.1.1.254. The nodes and their corresponding IP addresses are ubuntu1 - 10.1.1.1, alpine1 - 10.1.1.2, centos1 - 10.1.1.3, and redhat1 - 10.1.1.4. Also, while generation, you should not assume a variable or file exists in the system architecture. In case a variable or file is needed for the playbook, define/create them in the playbook itself.

        Your main task is to unveil the latent bugs in the Ansible compiler using the provided github issue as an inspiration, adapted to the specific network setup.

        - "As an advanced AI agent, you are tasked to discover potential bugs in the Ansible compiler by generating Ansible Playbooks based on GitHub issue titles and bodies. This process involves the use of fuzzing techniques and a deep understanding of Ansible's syntax and best practices to enhance the security and robustness of software projects. The subtasks to achieve this goal are as follows:\n 1. Understand the Issue: Analyze the GitHub issue title and body to gain a deep understanding of the context, problem, and nuances. Consider associated comments as supplementary information for your analysis.\n 2. Generate Ansible Code Snippet: Based on the issue analysis, generate a single, syntactically correct Ansible code snippet. This snippet should be crafted in a way that, when executed, has the potential to uncover new bugs in the Ansible compiler, rather than recreating known issues. Remember, users will primarily focus on this first code snippet.\n 3. Incorporate Network Details: The generated Ansible code snippet should take into account the specific inventory file that includes four Docker nodes with different Linux distributions. These nodes are connected to a network (node-net) with a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 and a gateway of 10.1.1.254. The nodes and their corresponding IP addresses are ubuntu1 - 10.1.1.1, alpine1 - 10.1.1.2, centos1 - 10.1.1.3, and redhat1 - 10.1.1.4. Ensure that the code snippet can be evaluated using the following command: ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory --private-key /var/tmp/key_I.pem --become-password-file <path_to_password_file>."
        - As an advanced AI agent, your primary objective is to discover potential bugs in the Ansible compiler by employing fuzzing techniques and generating Ansible Playbooks based on GitHub issue titles. This approach aims to enhance the security and robustness of software projects while streamlining the development process. To achieve this goal, follow the numbered task flow:\n 1. Analyze the given GitHub issue title to pinpoint potential areas for discovering bugs in the Ansible compiler through fuzzing techniques.\n2. Use your understanding of Ansible's syntax, best practices, and the fuzzing process to devise a strategy for creating tailored Playbooks that address the identified issues.\n3. Generate a targeted Ansible Playbook based on the GitHub issue title, ensuring it focuses on the specific vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the compiler.\n4. Construct syntactically correct Ansible code snippets within the Playbook, designed to expose potential issues within the Ansible compiler. \nTo achieve this objective, you will utilize an inventory file consisting of three Docker nodes with Ubuntu images. These nodes are connected to a network named 'node-net' with a subnet of 10.1.1.0/24 and a gateway of 10.1.1.254. The nodes and their corresponding IP addresses are as follows, node1 - 10.1.1.1, node2 - 10.1.1.2, and node3 - 10.1.1.3. By creating Ansible code snippets that consider this inventory file, you aim to contribute to a more stable and reliable Ansible ecosystem, assisting users in identifying, testing, and resolving problems. Ensure that the generated Ansible code snippets can be evaluated using the command - ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory --private-key /path/key.
