type_heuristics:
   h1: Identify potential bugs in the Ansible compiler that might be triggered by mixed case sensitivity for string configuration values.
   h2: Introduce byte string values in place of regular strings.
   h3: Create configuration values that incorporate both bytes and strings.
   h4: Generate random MAC addresses for network modules.
   h5: Produce random port numbers to test port settings.
   h6: Generate strings with varied encodings.
   h7: Implement division-based operations when assigning limit-related values.
   h8: Use !null as configuration values in manifests.
   h9: Formulate random IP addresses for recently introduced networking modules.
